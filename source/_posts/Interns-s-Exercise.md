# 一些python的练习
##1. Add Digits
```
'''
 Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.

For example:

Given num = 38, the process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

Follow up:
Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?
'''

class Solution(object):
    def addDigits(self, num):
      pass
```

##2. array partition i
```
'''
 Given an array of 2n integers, your task is to group these integers
 into n pairs of integer, say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn)
 which makes sum of min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.

Example 1:

Input: [1,4,3,2]

Output: 4
Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4.

Note:

    n is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000].
    All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].

'''
class Solution(object):
    def arrayPairSum(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        pass
```
